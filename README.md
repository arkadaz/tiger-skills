# tiger-skills

Two Claude Code skill systems that work together — **harness-engineering** (outer loop) builds the engineering infrastructure around AI coding agents, and **code-quality** (inner loop) enforces design principles on every line of code, in any language. 15 skills, 10 agents, 8 hooks, 2 commands, and a deterministic multi-agent workflow — one plugin. The GATE 11 review cluster checks structure, **behavior** (adversarial correctness + mandatory E2E/regression tests), and **security** — separately.

Based on [Learn Harness Engineering](https://walkinglabs.github.io/learn-harness-engineering/en/) by walkinglabs and *Software Design for Python Programmers* by Ronald Mak.

## How It Works

The conductor runs a **Gate Sequence** on every request — mechanical, not advisory, with a live ledger it ticks off so no step is dropped:

```
GATE 0 bootstrap → GATE 1 SPEC GATE (no spec → grill first) → GATE 2 ledger →
clock in → SCOPE (WIP=1) → PLAN (persist tasks into feature_list.json) →
[architect] → GENERATE (E2E test first) → EXECUTE (full suite + E2E) → [heal ×3] →
VERIFY → REVIEW CLUSTER (quality + correctness + [security]) →
TRACK (tasks + acceptance_criteria + commit) → clock out
```

**The outer loop** (harness-engineering) ensures the agent grills out a spec before building, knows what to work on, keeps the plan in the repo (not just chat), stays in scope, verifies before claiming completion, and leaves a clean state. **The inner loop** (code-quality) ensures every line of code follows 16 design principles and language-specific rules — and every agent must prove it invoked its required skill.

## How to Use

### Just Talk to Claude — the Skills Activate Automatically

You don't need to remember skill names. Just describe what you want, and the right skill activates:

| You say... | Skill that activates |
|------------|---------------------|
| "I want to add X" / "can we build…" / a feature idea | `harness-engineering-grill` (Spec Gate — interviews you, writes a spec, waits for approval) |
| "Set up this project for AI agents" | `harness-engineering-bootstrap` |
| "What are we working on?" / "Start a session" | `harness-engineering-session` |
| "Let's work on feature X" | `harness-engineering-feature` |
| "Is this done?" / "Verify my changes" | `harness-engineering-verify` |
| "Review my code" | `harness-engineering-review` or `code-quality-review` |
| "Why did this fail?" / "The agent keeps messing up" | `harness-engineering-diagnose` |
| "Improve this code" / "Make this cleaner" | `code-quality` (router, delegates to sub-skills) |
| "Audit this for design violations" | `code-quality-audit` |
| "Fix these violations" | `code-quality-fix` |
| "Write/review code in any language" (Python, Rust, TS, Go, Java, C#, …) | `code-quality-language` (infers the language's idioms) |

### The Full Workflow

**Phase 0 — Grill (Spec Gate):** Describe a new feature and Claude interviews you relentlessly across five dimensions (problem, happy path, errors, constraints, acceptance), one question at a time, then writes `specs/<feature-id>.md` and waits for your approval. The `spec-gate` hook makes this mechanical — no planning or code without an approved spec. Bug fixes and one-line edits skip it.

**Phase 1 — Start a session:** Just start working. The SessionStart hook reminds Claude to clock in — read `AGENTS.md`, `progress.md`, `feature_list.json`, and run `./init.sh`. For multi-step work Claude keeps a **live phase ledger** it ticks off so no step is dropped.

**Phase 2 — Pick a feature:** Say what you want to build. Claude reads `feature_list.json`, enforces WIP=1, and picks the highest-priority feature whose `depends_on` are all `passing`. The planner's blueprint is **persisted into the feature's `tasks[]`** (kanban sub-tickets) so the plan lives in the repo, not just in chat.

**Phase 3 — Build:** Claude writes code. The Explore-before-code hook ensures it reads existing types and functions first. Code-quality rules enforce types, DI, enums, logging, and flat functions on every line.

**Phase 4 — Verify:** Before claiming anything is done, Claude runs the 3-layer pipeline (static → **full** unit suite → **E2E**) and records evidence. E2E is mandatory for any user-visible behavior — an E2E test of the real workflow is what catches "passed its unit tests but is buggy when I run it." The full suite (no fail-fast) surfaces regressions, and every bug fix ships a failing-first regression test. The pre-commit hook blocks commits until verification passes.

**Phase 5 — Review cluster:** For non-trivial changes, Claude spawns up to three independent reviewers that never wrote the code and check different things: `reviewer` (16 principles + 11 tooling rules), `correctness-reviewer` (adversarially traces the flow, enumerates edge cases, hunts logic bugs, and proves every acceptance criterion with a real test), and `security-reviewer` (when the change touches auth, input, queries, I/O, deserialization, crypto/secrets, or a new dependency). A clean structure audit does not mean the code is correct or safe.

**Phase 6 — Wrap up:** Claude flips each `tasks[]` entry and `acceptance_criteria` item to done with evidence, marks the feature `passing` only when all of them are, and updates `progress.md`. The pre-push hook blocks pushes until state files are current. The Stop hook reminds Claude to leave a clean restart path.

### Slash Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/tiger-skills:review-branch` | Review the current branch — runs verification pipeline, spawns code quality review, checks spec compliance, produces a report |
| `/tiger-skills:install-workflow` | Copy the bundled deterministic Workflow into this project's `.claude/workflows/` so the team gets it on clone |

### Deterministic Workflow — run the pipeline the same way every time

The conductor's mechanical pipeline (GATES 5–12) also ships as a **deterministic, git-committed Claude Code Workflow** — a JS script that spawns the 10 agents identically on every run (including the GATE 11 review cluster: quality + correctness + security), instead of the conductor re-improvising the plan. You review it once in a PR and trust it forever.

```
explore → plan → [architect?] → persist-tasks → generate
        → execute (full suite + E2E) → (heal + regression test → regenerate → re-execute){≤3}
        → review cluster: reviewer + correctness-reviewer + [security-reviewer]
        → (fix → re-execute → re-review){≤3} → track
```

**Boundary:** the human gates stay interactive — bootstrap, grill, and **spec approval** happen in conversation first; the workflow runs only an *already-approved* feature. The mechanical part is deterministic; the judgment part stays with you.

**Use it:**

1. **Install it into a project (once):** run `/tiger-skills:install-workflow`, then commit `.claude/workflows/tiger-pipeline.js` so teammates get it on clone.
2. **Finish GATES 0–4 in chat:** bootstrap, grill, **approve the spec**, pick one feature (WIP=1).
3. **Run it:** `/workflows tiger-pipeline` with the feature's `args` (`featureId`, `featureTitle`, `specFile`, `projectDir`, `today`, and the architect-trigger flags). See [`workflows/README.md`](workflows/README.md) for the full table.
4. **Watch live** in `/workflows` — `p` pause, `x` stop an agent, `r` restart, `s` save.

> **Prerequisites:** Claude Code ≥ 2.1.154 with dynamic workflows enabled, and the `tiger-skills` plugin installed (the workflow spawns its agents). The Workflow runtime is a research-preview API — dry-run on a small approved feature before making it a team default. Full guide: [`workflows/README.md`](workflows/README.md).

### Example Prompts

```
"Set up harness files for this project"
→ Creates AGENTS.md, feature_list.json, progress.md, init.sh

"Make this code better"
→ Invokes code-quality: reviews against all 16 principles

"Why does Claude keep re-implementing features we already have?"
→ harness-engineering-diagnose attributes to State layer, fixes progress.md

"Review my PR before I merge"
→ Runs verification pipeline + independent code quality review

"I'm done for today"
→ Clock-out: updates all state files, runs exit checklist
```

## The Five Subsystems (walkinglabs)

Every complete harness has five subsystems:

| Subsystem | Question It Answers | Minimal Artifact |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Instructions** | What should the agent know? | `AGENTS.md` |
| **Environment** | Can the agent run and verify? | `init.sh` |
| **State** | What happened last session? | `progress.md`, `feature_list.json` |
| **Scope** | What exactly to work on? | Feature boundaries + definition of done |
| **Verification** | How to know it's correct? | `./init.sh` verification pipeline |

## Skills Reference

### Harness Engineering (Outer Loop)

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|------------|
| `harness-engineering` | **Conductor** — orchestrates the full agent workflow. Start here for any task. |
| `harness-engineering-bootstrap` | Creating AGENTS.md, feature_list.json, progress.md, init.sh from scratch |
| `harness-engineering-session` | Clock-in (read state) or clock-out (update state, 8-item exit checklist) |
| `harness-engineering-feature` | Feature lifecycle — pick one feature, WIP=1, definition of done |
| `harness-engineering-verify` | Evidence before claims — 3-layer pipeline (static → unit → E2E) |
| `harness-engineering-review` | Independent harness compliance review — separate doer from checker |
| `harness-engineering-diagnose` | Attribute failure to 1 of 5 layers, fix the harness, retry |

### Code Quality (Inner Loop)

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|------------|
| `code-quality` | **Router** — load principles here, route to sub-skills for specific tasks |
| `code-quality-language` | Universal tooling rules for **any** language — infers its idioms (Python/Rust are worked examples) |
| `code-quality-review` | Independent review against 16 principles + 11 tooling rules (27 items) |
| `code-quality-audit` | Full design principle audit with ranked violation report |
| `code-quality-fix` | Apply known fix patterns for specific violation types |
| `code-correctness-review` | Adversarial behavior review — trace flow, enumerate edge cases, hunt logic bugs, prove every acceptance criterion with a real test (unit + E2E) |
| `security-review` | Trigger-based security audit — injection, authz, secrets, crypto, deserialization, deps, DoS |

## 16 Design Principles

| # | Principle | # | Principle |
|---|-----------|---|-----------|
| 1 | Single Responsibility | 9 | Least Astonishment |
| 2 | Encapsulate What Varies | 10 | Lazy Evaluation |
| 3 | Least Knowledge (Law of Demeter) | 11 | Class Invariant |
| 4 | Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) | 12 | Precondition |
| 5 | Open-Closed | 13 | Postcondition |
| 6 | Code to the Interface | 14 | Delegation |
| 7 | Liskov Substitution | 15 | Factory |
| 8 | Composition over Inheritance | 16 | Defensive Programming |

## Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Explore before code** — read existing files, discover types/functions/patterns BEFORE writing
2. **Check the harness first** — when the model fails, the problem is in the harness
3. **Evidence before claims** — never say "done" without fresh verification output
4. **WIP = 1** — exactly one feature active at a time
5. **No placeholders** — `pass`, `TODO`, `NotImplementedError` forbidden in committed code
6. **Leave a clean state** — every session ends with the repo restartable from `./init.sh`
7. **Separate doer from checker** — an independent review cluster (quality + correctness + security) audits non-trivial work; none of them wrote the code
8. **Verify behavior, not just structure** — user-facing features ship an E2E test of the real workflow; the full suite runs (no fail-fast) to catch regressions; every fix adds a failing-first regression test

## Hooks

8 event-driven hooks enforce the harness gates mechanically:

| Event | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | **Spec gate** — build request + no approved spec → invoke `grill` first |
| `SessionStart` | Clock-in reminder — read state files, run `./init.sh` |
| `PreToolUse` (Write/Edit) | Bootstrap gate — warn if harness files don't exist |
| `PreToolUse` (Write/Edit) | Explore-before-code — remind to discover types first |
| `PreToolUse` (Agent) | **Pre-agent-spawn gate** — confirm spec + ledger + WIP=1 before spawning the pipeline |
| `PreToolUse` (git commit) | Pre-commit check — confirm verification ran |
| `PreToolUse` (git push) | Pre-push check — confirm state files updated |
| `Stop` | Clock-out reminder — 8-item exit checklist |

## Agents

10 custom sub-agents in a defined workflow:

```
Explorer → Planner → [Code Architect] → Generator → Executor → [Healer] → REVIEW CLUSTER → Scribe
              ↑                              │            │          │       ├─ reviewer (quality)
              │                              │            │          │       ├─ correctness-reviewer
              └──────── feedback loop ───────┴───────── (heal /      │       └─ [security-reviewer]
                                                      review loops) ─┘
Scribe = single writer of feature_list.json + progress.md (applies every agent's Board Update)
```

| Agent | Model | Role | Required-skill proof line |
|-------|-------|------|---------------------------|
| `explorer` | sonnet | Read-only recon; build the Type Inventory for the planner | `Type Inventory built: YES` |
| `planner` | opus | Decompose goals into blueprints; emit `tasks[]` | `code-architect consulted: YES/NO` |
| `code-architect` | opus | Architecture review, SOLID, pattern selection | `code-quality-audit invoked: YES` |
| `generator` | sonnet | Write code from blueprints (TDD; E2E test first, then unit) | `code-quality-language invoked: YES` |
| `executor` | sonnet | Run verification (full suite + mandatory E2E), collect evidence | `harness-engineering-verify invoked: YES` |
| `healer` | opus | Diagnose failures, prescribe fix + failing-first regression test | `harness-engineering-diagnose invoked: YES` |
| `reviewer` | opus | Independent quality check vs. spec + 16 principles (never wrote the code) | `code-quality-review invoked: YES` |
| `correctness-reviewer` | opus | Adversarial behavior check — trace flow, prove each AC with a test | `correctness-review invoked: YES` |
| `security-reviewer` | opus | Security check when triggered — injection, authz, secrets, crypto, deps | `security-review invoked: YES` |
| `scribe` | sonnet | Single writer of `feature_list.json` + `progress.md` | `feature_list.json valid after write: YES` |

**Proof of invocation:** every agent must begin its report with its proof line. The conductor rejects a handoff without one and re-spawns the agent — this is what stops agents from skipping their required skill (e.g. the architect actually running the 16-principle design audit instead of eyeballing it).

**Board Update contract:** agents never edit the board directly. Each emits a `Board Update` block (`task T2 → passing`, `acceptance_criteria AC3 → done`) and the **scribe** — the single writer — applies it, refusing anything that breaks an invariant (feature `passing` only when all tasks pass and all criteria are done; WIP=1; links reciprocal and acyclic). One writer = no drift.
